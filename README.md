# Food Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Overview

Welcome to the Food Classification project! This repository focuses on binary and multiclass classification of images belonging to 10 different food classes using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The goal is to leverage the power of CNNs for accurate and efficient food image classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains a diverse collection of food images, categorized into 10 different classes. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, enabling the training and evaluation of CNN models.

## CNN Architecture

Convolutional Neural Networks have proven to be highly effective for image classification tasks. The provided code implements a CNN architecture tailored for food classification, with customizable hyperparameters for experimentation.

## Binary Classification And MultiCLass Classification

In the binary classification section, the focus is on distinguishing between two specific food classes. The CNN model is trained to differentiate between these classes, showcasing the potential of deep learning for binary classification tasks.

In the multiclass classification section, the CNN model is extended to classify images into one of the 10 different food classes. This demonstrates the capability of CNNs to handle complex multiclass classification scenarios.

### Usage

To run the binary classification code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aryanrangapur/food-classification-project.git
   cd food-classification-cnn
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the binary classification/ multiclass classification script:
   ```bash
   python Binary_and_Multi_Class.py

## Results and Evaluation
Detailed results, model performance metrics, and evaluation summaries are provided in the results directory. Explore and analyze the performance of the CNN models for both binary and multiclass classification tasks.
